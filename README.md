Shell scripts to stop my computer from always dying

Quote from my blog:

When I switched to swm and wmutils I realized something:
I couldn't tell what my battery was.
I tried to get used to the uncomfortable feeling of fear whenever I was on my laptop.
I knew that any second my machine could power down.
A bunch of lost writing later, I set out to solve the problem.

Need help installing?
